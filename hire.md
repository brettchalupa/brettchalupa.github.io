# Let's Build Something Together

If you are looking for someone to build something together with, I may
be a good fit.

## About You

You are trying to do good and believe in what are doing. You are engaged
and believe in collaboration. You value and practice clear
communication. You listen as well as you speak.

You understand that building things can be difficult and take time.
You are flexible and willing to make compromises.

You believe that making decisions is progress and the momentum of
progress is the key to success.

## About Me

I spend my time creating things that help or entertain others. I have
always been a creator, and it is what I am passionate about.

I move quickly and am very focused.

### What I Do

I have experience and interest in doing the following: web, API, and iOS
development, app and brand design, website building, project management,
event organizing, teaching, training, and speaking.

See [Projects](/projects/) for specifics.

### How I Work

The driving motivators behind my life and my work are simplicity and
sustainability.

I truly believe less is more.

When building software, I want it to work and be maintainable for years
to come. I practice test driven development, write thorough
documentation, and build small, simple pieces to form the whole. Because
software is malleable, iteration is the key to progress.

Much like how I approach building software, my design, process, and
organizational work is focused on collaboration and simplicity.

My involvement and approach is different for each project. I have my
go to tools and processes to faciliate building things, but I am also
happy to use and integrate with existing tools and processes.

## Let's Do This

There are two options for working together: partnership or payment.

If you are looking to partner with me and the project is something I
am interested in, awesome.

If you are looking to pay me to work with you, I have a sliding scale
for my rate. If you are a non-profit or self-funded start-up, my rate is
$50/hr. If you are neither of those, my rate is $75/hr.

Sound good? Great. [Send me an email](mailto:brett@brettchalupa.com),
and let's build something together.
