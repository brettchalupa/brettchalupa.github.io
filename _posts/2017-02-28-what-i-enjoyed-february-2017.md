February, as usual, flew by. I spent most of my time working on my projects, but I was able to enjoy some great things.

## Books

I didn’t do too much reading in February. Most of my reading time was spent on the first draft of [Aperture](/aperture). Last month I started _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin, but I decided to put it on hold after 50 pages. I was having a hard time getting into the world and grasping all of the concepts introduced. I’d like to revisit it in the future, though.

## Movies

I watched half of _Mad Max: Fury Road - Black & Chrome_, but I didn’t finish it for some reason. I’m into the black and white visuals, so I’m going to try to finish it soon. Other than that, I didn’t watch any other movies in February.

## TV

### Girls

I started watching _Girls_ with my partner in February, and I’m hooked. I like how each character has their own personality, even though all of them feel a bit extreme. It feels like a modern version of _Friends_, minus the sitcom aspects.

## Games

### Fire Emblem Heroes

_Fire Emblem Heroes_ is a strategy game on iOS that I’ve been playing and somewhat enjoying. It’s part of a long-running series of games, which I have played a few of. It doesn’t have the depth of its predecessors, but it scratches an itch. It’s free to play and not too in your face about microtransactions, which I appreciate.

## Music

### _Forget_ by Xiu Xiu

The latest Xiu Xiu album _Forget_ came out at the end of February, and I think it’s a very good album. It feels distinct from the other Xiu Xiu albums I’ve listened to but still familiar.

My favorite songs on the album thus far are “Get Up,” “Hay Choco Bananas,”
and “At Last, At Last.”

### _Fabulous Muscles_ by Xiu Xiu

In preparation for _Forget_, I bought _Fabulous Muscles_ at the very beginning of the month. It’s a solid album, but I think I’m enjoying _Forget_ more. A song from the album named “Bunny Gamer (B)” is regularly stuck in my head, although “Clowne Towne” is my favorite.

## Podcasts

### [5by5 Movies: Glengarry Glenross](http://5by5.tv/movies/2)

An in-depth analysis by two of my favorite podcasters, Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin, about a great movie, Glengarry Glenross. If you’ve seen the movie before, it’s worth the listen. It made me appreciate the film in a new way.
