I've been making a little Snake game called _Slither_ as an effort to experiment with hand-drawn, scanned-in graphics in games and to learn how to make games for iOS and Android with DragonRuby GTK. [You can play it now](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/slither), even though it's not finished yet.

This v0.1 release is my progress so farâ€”just a basic Snake game with custom graphics for web and desktop. The next release, v0.2, will focus on getting it working nicely on touch devices. Then I'll polish it up and call it done.

_Slither_ is dedicated to the public domain and is an educational freeware project.

Ideas for what's could come:

- More polish
- Grid display
- Tutorial
- Difficulty (speed) setting
- Music & more sfx
- Mobile builds! (will be free)
- Ouroborus mode where you can continue to play if you eat your tail; essentially bonus round!

Anyway, enjoy this little game! I'm having fun making it, and I'm learning, which is what matters most to me right now.
