After a half a year running and developing software at Gristmill, I am back to
doing my own thing. It was a valuable experience where I learned a
lot about doing contract work for clients and building web
applications with Ruby on Rails.

It is now spring, and the weather is unbelievably gorgeous. I am thankful to have
more time to work on personal projects and enjoy nature. I moved
into a studio a few blocks away from home with [Craig
Winslow](http://craigwinslow.com), a talented and kind individual.

I am optimistic about the future. My expectations are simple and humble.
I want to make things because I can. I want to work on what interests me
everyday. I want to cherish the relationships I have and form new ones.
I want to continue to grow, learn and teach others.

There is no company or project to announce, thankfully. I am just going
to work on what sounds fun and seeing where it takes me. I have no desire
to make the Next Big Thing. I just want to make things. Things that I
use, things that I play, things that people enjoy, things that help
people.
