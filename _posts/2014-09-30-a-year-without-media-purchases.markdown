I have been asking myself, "What would it look like to spend a year not spending
money on any media and focused on enjoying what I already have?"

I am not sure what the answer is, but I want to find out. I am committing to not
purchasing any new consumable media for the next year.

This includes:

- purchasing music, like digital albums and records
- purchasing games
- purchasing books
- purchasing movies/shows
- subscribing to services like netflix or rdio

As a little exception, I am going to make it okay to go to the movies a couple
times a year. I think the movie theater is more of an experience than purchasing
some kind of media.

Downloading/enjoying free media is okay - like a free album on Bandcamp.

I really want to focus on enjoying what I have instead of spending all this
money of stuff I do not even enjoy. Ideally, I will keep a log of times when I
want to purchase something, but logs seems to always start with the best
intentions and rarely happen.

I am not trying to not support folks who create things; I want to enjoy what I
already have. I feel that the consumerist lifestyle I live is harmful, and I
want to understand more about it.
