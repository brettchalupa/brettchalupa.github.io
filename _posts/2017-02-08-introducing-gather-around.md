As I have been recording and sharing the audio versions of my short stories, I have been wanting to find an easy way for people to listen to them offline and on mobile devices. On Saturday the idea hit me: why don’t I release the stories as a podcast? Well, I decided to go for it. It’s called [_Gather Around_](/gather-around).

Each short story is its own episode, which seems fitting. I have two upcoming novel projects where I’ll release each chapter of the audiobook through _Gather Around_ as well. I will continue to do my best to publish a new story every week.

I am going to keep the feed strictly fiction. No ads, just stories.

It was easy to setup since I have [been uploading the narrated stories to SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/gather_around). All I had to do was figure out the name, create the cover, and submit the RSS feed to places like iTunes and Google Play Music. Like most of my projects, I am viewing it as an experiment and will see how it goes.
