**This is for my previous site setup, which can be seen
[here](http://brettchalupa.herkou.com).**

This site is built with [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/), a CMS powered by [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com). It is very simple. There is no database or back-end. All content is writen in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or [HAML](http://haml.info/).

It uses [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for hosting. Heroku is free for hosting applications that only require a single dyno and little (or no) database.

There are no analytics or tracking. I am not interested in how many people view the site.

To make the site look nice on touchtronic devices, I am using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com). It is small in size, stays out of the way and is easy to work with.

The design is heavily inspired by [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com). I am tired of social media buttons, advertisements, generic images and annoying pop-ups. Just clean type and content from the heart.

A website's platform and technology should not get in the way of sharing content. It should make it easier.
