I have been organizing the [Burlington Ruby
Conference](http://burlingtonruby.com) this year with some
friends and colleagues. It is happening on August 3rd and 4th, which
should be a gorgeous weekend in Vermont. The goal has been to put on a
comfortable, afforadable and fun conference in the beautiful town of
Burlington.

I am honestly so excited to be working diligently daily to make the
conference awesome. [Ticket sales just opened
today](http://burlingtonruby.com/#tickets), and I really hope that the
attendees are as excited as I am. 

What is left to do is select the speakers (we got over 50 proposals!)
and organize the activities and talks. There are four months left, and
the conference organizing started in early January. It is crazy to think
it takes so much work to organize a conference, but it is such an
amazing experience.

My favorite part so far has been meeting new people and working closely
with the other organizers. Being involved in the community is so
emotionally rewarding.

Once the conference happens, I am going to create an overview guide of
the process of putting on the conference for those interested in
organizing their own conference. I have learned a lot so far, and I am
sure there is much more to learn during the actual conference!
