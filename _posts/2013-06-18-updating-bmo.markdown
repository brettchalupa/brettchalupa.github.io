I have been planning and working on an overhaul of [BMO](/bmo). The goal
is to create a more maintainable and better tested code base, create a visual
identity and have a master BMO that can host multiple jams.

I have created a [place for updates and news](http://jamonbmo.tumblr.com/), which will
the place where development updates and new jams on BMO lives.

If you have any feedback, suggestions or requests for the new BMO,
totally [let me know](https://twitter.com/brettchalupa)!
