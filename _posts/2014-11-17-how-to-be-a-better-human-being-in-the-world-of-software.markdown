I think the world of software is a special one. Software is this
mixture of objective creativity that is used and experienced by others. It is
accessible in the way that a computer can give access to building software.
There is not much else required to get started. One can build software from
anywhere, not be required to have a degree to do it, express oneself
creatively, be part of a community, and make a good living. However, there is a
glaring issue that I see right now in the world of software. The lack of diversity
and the way folks approach it.

For the time that I have been involved in the world of software, about six
years, I have been mostly surrounded by folks that appear to be just like me -
white and male. If the world of software is this fairly accessible thing,
shouldn't there be more diversity in who is part of it? Over the past six years,
I feel like I have learned very important things in regards to this issue. Here
is what I have learned:

- Listen to people and reflect before vocalizing a knee-jerk reaction. When people
  listen to someone explaining why a behavior is not good and they are guilty of
  that behavior, the first reaction is to get defensive. It happens to me, and
  it is a strange feeling. Instead of getting defensive, think about it and
  reflect on it. If it is something you do not want to do anymore, make an
  effort to stop doing it. If it is something you do not agree with, talk to the
  person and learn more about why they feel that way.
- Think about what you are saying before you say it. When I say "saying" I
  literally mean the choice of words which leave your mouth and keyboard. Each
  one has a meaning, and that meaning could be offensive to people. For example,
  stop referring to groups of people as "guys". Just because "it is common
  speak" does not make it okay. You may be addressing a group of people who are not
  all males or identify as males. It is important to think about what you are
  saying from the context of those you are saying it to, not just yourself.
- Accept and understand that your view is not the same view as others, and that
  seeing other's views are what will help you learn and grow. Being open minded
  and understanding will go a long way.
- Educate yourself by reading more about diversity. I would suggest reading
  _Feminism is for Everybody_ by Bell Hooks, the [Geek Feminism
  wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki), and [Model View
  Culture](https://modelviewculture.com). They are a good starting place.
  Dig in and think about what you are reading. Then, when you
  have read those, keep finding more things to read. Keep learning about this
  issue.
- Ask questions if you do not understand something. There are people who would
  be happy to try to answer your questions, myself included.
- Do not be a jerk. I think this goes without saying, but be compassionate and
  understanding.
- If you are part of an organization that builds software, work with other
  people in the organization to help improve the human-side of the organization.
  If it is a workplace, research how to have better hiring practices. Take a
  look at [making non-alienating job
  listings](https://storify.com/kissane/job-listings-that-don-t-alienate) for a
  place to start. Think about how the culture of your organization may appear to
  people who are not like you. Are there ways it could be adjusted to be more
  approachable by others?
- Talk to people about this stuff, do not sweep it under the rug. For a while, I
  felt like there was nothing I could do about the lack of diversity in the
  world of software, so I ignored it. I turned my head and chose not to think
  about it. This was wrong, and I do not want to see other people do the same.
- Be vocal about this issues and help raise awareness of their existance. Effect
  change; don't just be a bystander.

It is important to realize the following: you can help make the human part of
software better. It will take time and be challenging, but there are people
here to help you. You may make mistakes, you may say the wrong thing, but what
is most important is to keep learning, keep staying open-minded, and keep being
active in your efforts.
