Look people in the eye while your talking to them. Smile when what it is said makes you happy. Laugh when it's funny. Give a pat on the back or a hug when it's sad. Make a funny face when you're feeling weird.

Be genuinely interested and listen to the person talking. Ask questions and help move the conversation along. Let it be natural. Let it be awkward. Learn something about that person, learn something from that person, or just learn something about yourself. Most importantly, just be yourself.

Do not look at your phone while someone is talking to you. Whatever is happening on your phone can wait. The conversation you are having in person is far more valuable. You can see their eyes and their body. You can hear the inflection in their voice. Enjoy it. Attempt to have more meaningful conversations with family and friends. Talk about what matters to you, what you have been enjoying and what is frustrating. It really helps build stronger relationships.
