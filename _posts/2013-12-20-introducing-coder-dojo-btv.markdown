I am working on starting a local [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojo.com) in
Burlington, Vermont. It is called [Coder Dojo BTV](http://coderdojobtv.com), and
the first session is going to be at some point in January. [A friend of
mine](http://mikefowler.me) is involved with the San Francisco Coder Dojo and
asked why is there not a dojo in Burlington? I took this as a personal challenge,
deciding to set off to start one.

The goal is simple: create a regular place for youth to learn how to code from
industry professionals, beginners and peers. I think it is going to be a whole
lot of fun!
