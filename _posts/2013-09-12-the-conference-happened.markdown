Holy smokes, it happened. It came and went in an instant. The Burlington Ruby Conference happened!

The conference was a huge success by our standards. We "sold out", selling our goal of 150 tickets. There were no huge mishaps or blusters. It was just a fun weekend filled with great talks, great folks and great food.

I have been blown away by all of the positive feedback from attendees. I really appreciate all of the personal thank yous. Organizing the conference is something that all of the organizers did in their free time for fun, and it was totally worth it.

All of the talks were recorded by Confreaks and are [being uploaded as I write this](http://confreaks.com/events/btvruby2013). I am collecting all of the speaker's slidedecks and source code and will be posting them to the [conference website](http://burlingtonruby.com).

Things are already in motion for the conference next year. The plan is to keep the conference the same size and maintain a similar structure (half-hour talks and half-hour breaks). Next year there will be more coffee, *I swear*.

I really want to thank the attendees, speakers, sponsors and fellow organizers. The conference could not have happened without any of you, and it was honestly one of the best weekends I have ever had.
