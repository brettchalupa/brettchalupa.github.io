Some days are downers. I try my best to stay positive, but that is
not always enough. Here are some simple ways I improve my day:

1. Go for a walk
2. Eat some fruit
3. Spend time with a loved one
4. [Watch a Maru video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZR_6K03gWk)
5. Listen to some music, sing and dance
6. Meditate

Things I find myself doing on bad days that do **not** help:
spending money, eating unhealthy food, and spending time alone.
Those do not help.

I hope that your day is going well. You deserve it. If not, I hope these six
simple things can make your day a little better!
