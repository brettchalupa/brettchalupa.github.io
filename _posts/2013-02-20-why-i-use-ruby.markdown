I use Ruby because it is beautiful and elegant.

I use Ruby because the syntax is friendly.

I use Ruby because it is fun.

I use Ruby because it has a lower barrier of entry than most languages.

I use Ruby because it is cross-platform.

I use Ruby because I can develop web applications, games and mobile applications with it.

I use Ruby because it lets me easily translate my thoughts into code.
