_Note: I am going to refer to free (as in freedom) as libre throughout this
post. I am uncertain if it is any better than the term free, but I like it more
and that is reason enough for me to use it._

I have been thinking a lot about libre software and what it means
to me. I understand why it is important, but I have struggled to find a
practical setup that works (for me). I have made some steps towards what I
believe is a pragmatic setup for working towards a more libre life in regards to
software.

While whether or not something is entirely libre is a yes or no answer, I do
believe that certain things are more libre than others. My goal is to use most
libre software where possible. This means the software I use is free (as in
freedom), and the files I have are DRM-free.

Here is what I did:

- I switched from Apple hardware and OS X to a Lenovo laptop running Ubuntu. While
  I understand that Ubuntu is not the most libre distro, it is what I am most
  familiar with, and it felt like a good place to start. Switching distros is
  not a huge deal, so I plan on exploring others in the future.
- I redownloaded all of the music I have purchased on Bandcamp in open formats.
  Hooray for such an awesome service that supports various file formats!
- I downloaded the games that support GNU/Linux from my Humble Bundle account,
  which are all DRM-free.
- I switched from an Apple iPhone to a Moto G running Android 4.4. Developing
  software for an iPhone without OS X is not possible, so that kind of ruled out
  the iPhone. Also, with Android and the Moto G I can easily play my .ogg and
  .flac music, expand the memory with a microSD card, change the battery, use
  the micro USB cables I already own, and develop applications on the device
  without paying money upfront. Those are all pretty big wins for me. While
  Android may not be 100% libre, I think it is a step in the right direction
  from iOS.
- I made DuckDuckGo my default search engine. It is a really solid alternative
  to Google.
- I started using Hover for email instead of Gmail. While I may not have direct
  control over the email server, I feel like it is less worse than Gmail.
- I continue to use Firefox for my web browser. The developer tools are great,
  and it is consistently improving.

These steps felt like they were in the right direction. It feels good.
