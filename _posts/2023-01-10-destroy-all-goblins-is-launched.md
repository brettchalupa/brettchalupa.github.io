After a month of work, my largest game to date, is finished! It's called _Destroy All Goblins_.

_Destroy All Goblins_ is a small freeware game for personal computers. It's inspired by _Super Crate Box_, and it uses art assets by [Pixel Frog](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/) from the public domain.

I had such a fun time making it, and I learned a ton. I'm looking forward to reflecting and writing a post-mortem after I have a little space from the project. I'm not quite sure what I'll work on next, but I've got a lot of ideas.

For now though, it's time to take a little break from such focus and relax a little bit!
