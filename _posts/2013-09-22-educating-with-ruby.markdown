**Why Ruby is a Great Language for Teaching (and Learning) Programming**

On Saturday, September 20, 2013, I gave a presentation at the [VT Code
Camp](http://vtcodecamp.org/) on how I learned programming, how I
taught programming and why I think Ruby is the most effective language
for learning and teaching programming.

Below are the slides. They give a brief overview of what I talked
about.

Thank you everyone who came to the talk, I really appreciate it!
