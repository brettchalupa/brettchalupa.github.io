I gave this talk at the February [Portland Ruby
Brigade](http://pdxruby.org/) meetup. The talk is about making the most
of the `lib` directory in Rails applications. It goes over the benefits
to using lib, examples of when to use lib, and how to test code in lib.

There was a video recording of the talk, so when that gets uploaded to
YouTube I will add it here.

Here are the slides for now:
