[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a collection of challenging programming problems. There
are over 400 problems, as of writing this. That is enough to keep anyone
busy for at least a year! One of the many great things about Project
Euler is that the problems are language agnostic. Whether you use Ruby,
F#, C, etc. it does not matter. What matters is your ability to approach
the problems programmatically and solve them.

For example, here is Problem 3:

    The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

    What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

If that is not an exciting challenge, then I do not know what is.

I have been slowly progressing through each problem. Some take me
a few hours and others a few days. It has been great to revisit a lot of
math that I have not used in years. A lot my time programming lately has
been for business purposes and not for learning purposes - this is a
huge problem. Working on Project Euler is one of my efforts to do
more fun programming. More time needs to be spent programming for fun
and learning.

I recommend anyone who is interested in program try and solve Project
Euler problems with their favorite language or a new one. There is not
much better than the rush of solving a problem.
