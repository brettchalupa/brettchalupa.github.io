Whoa, talk about wild. Last night I had a dream about season three of Twin Peaks. It was strange and dark, and it didn't make any sense. Laura Palmer and Audrey Horne were in it, but grown up. There were new characters, and they were younger. And there was a close up shot of a man's nose, mouth, and left eye. He had stubble on his face. I think it was BOB. 

When I woke up, I immediately thought to myself, _I wonder if there's any new news on the new series?_ To my great surprise, there's a new teaser of one of my favorite characters, Gordon Cole, eating a donut.

It is happening again.
