This week’s new story is “Lunar Space Colony.” It’s about a mechanical engineer named Bri who starts a new job on a space colony that orbits the Moon. She soon discovers something is a bit off.

I also created a narrated version of the story (with music by [Gahlord Dewald](http://gahlorddewald.com)):

“Lunar Space Colony” was originally written for an [@ellowrites challenge](https://ello.co/ellowrites/post/hyhu30ulxwgdfydrcg81jq):

> Create a utopia. We mean it. No dystopias masquerading as utopias. Both fiction and essay welcome.
> If you’d like a target word count, shoot for 2,000, though any length is fine.

It’ll be collected in [_Alder_](http://www.brettchalupa.com/alder) when all of the stories are complete.
