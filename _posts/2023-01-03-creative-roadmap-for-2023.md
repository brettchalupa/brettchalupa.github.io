As I look forward to the year ahead, I’d like to approach it with a fierce focus on and determination to finish my projects. I’m pleased with what I got done in 2022, and I’d like to keep that momentum.

My primary focus is going to be making games because I’m enamored with the art form and love how it combines visuals, audio, design, and player interaction.

Here’s what I’m setting out to accomplish in the new year:

1. Release at least 6 small freeware games
2. Be competent and confident with the game engine I’ve chosen
3. Release at least 1 of those games on widely on places like Steam, GOG, etc. to get experience with that process
4. Share my process and projects via my blog and [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/brettchalupa)

My goal is to eventually earn money (and, maybe, even a living) from making games. That was my dream when I was young, and I’ve never fully given up on it, even 15 years later. The difference between me today and me as a young adult is that I’ve got a lot more experience with finishing complex software projects (from my day job) and a lot more time spent on creative skills (from my artistic pursuits). I want to combine my technical skills and creative skills to earn a living.

Why would I aim to release 6 freeware games if I want to try to make money from my games? I’m being intentional with this decision. I have no allusions that my games will be very good and worth buying from the start. I also want to reduce the pressure on myself and instead focus on finishing small games.

I’m viewing 2023 as a year for establishing myself. If my freeware games are enjoyed by people, maybe they’ll follow along and become fans. To me, that’s a form of marketing and investment. Like what I made? There’s plenty more to come! I also need to establish my tools, engine, and workflow when it comes to making games. There’s a real trap I could fall into where I evaluate a half-dozen different engines and tools for a year and don’t actually make anything substantial. I’d much rather have an engine I know like the back of my hand and can work efficiently in. I’d rather leverage my work from game-to-game rather than starting fresh with a new game engine each time.

I believe in myself, but I’m also grounded in reality. I can’t work on one game for years right now—I don’t have the fortitude for it. I can’t just quit my job either and take a big risk. I need to think long-term and be intentional with my decisions. I’m okay with taking some risks, but they need to be measured and not a pipe dream.

I’m not at a loss for game ideas, but I also know new ideas will float on by. I’m not committed to any projects except those I’ve already started. Finishing things is my main priority.

That’s my plan for 2023. Make and finish at least 6 small games. Try to distribute one widely. Solidify the tools I use. Share what I learn along the way.

I’m having a blast with my projects so far, and I’m looking forward to what’s to come.
