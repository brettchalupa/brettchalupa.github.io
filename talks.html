  <h1>Talks</h1>

  <p>I try to give at least one talk every year. These are the talks I have
  given so far.</p>

  <ul class="posts">
    {% for talk in site.talks reversed %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{ talk.url }}">{{ talk.title }}</a>
        •
        <span class="date">{{ talk.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</span>
        •
        {{ talk.event }}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
