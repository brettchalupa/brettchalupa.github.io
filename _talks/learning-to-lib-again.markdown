I gave this talk at the February [Portland Ruby
Brigade](http://pdxruby.org/) meetup. The talk is about making the most
of the `lib` directory in Rails applications. It goes over the benefits
to using lib, examples of when to use lib, and how to test code in lib.
[Here are the slides.](https://speakerdeck.com/brettchalupa/learning-to-lib-again)
