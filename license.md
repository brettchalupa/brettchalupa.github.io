The terms below explain how my works and this website are licensed for
those who want to make use of either.

## Content

All of my works, unless otherwise noted, are licensed under:

The content includes journal entries, talks and their related slides,
images that I own the copyright to, and my works. This means that people
are free to share and adapt the content of this website and my works as
long as attribution and included changes are provided, it is released
non-commercially, and shared under the same license.

To give an example, it would be okay if someone took a character from one
of my stories and wrote a story with that character as long as I am
given attribution for the creation of the character, the work is
released for free, it is made clear that the story the character is set
in is the creation of the writer, and it is released under the same
license. It would not be okay if someone took my journal entries,
packaged them up into a book, and then sold that book.
