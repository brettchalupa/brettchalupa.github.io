I enjoyed quite a few albums released in 2016, some from artists that I have been listening to for years and some recent discoveries. My taste in music orbits indie rock, but some ambient, jazz, and Japanese dance music mixed in.

The highlights from this year for me were the following albums:

- _Blanco_ by David Bazan
- _Ruminations_ by Conor Oberst
- _22, A Million_ by Bon Iver
- _LP2_ by American Football
- _Art Nature_ by Tomggg

While I have enjoyed all of the honorable mentions this year, my favorite album of year is _Plays the Music of Twin Peaks_ by Xiu Xiu. Xiu Xiu reinterprets the music of Twin Peaks beautifully.

Highlights from the album [with song embeds]:

- _Blue Frank / Pink Room_ — This song is a combination of two songs from _Fire Walk with Me_, and they work very well together. Listening at a high volume is recommended.
- _Audrey’s Dance_ — the various horns and animal calls mixed with the xylophone are spot on
- _Dance of the Dream Man_
- _Falling_ — Jamie Stewart’s soft and emotional vocals are powerful in this cover of the opening song from the show.

_Plays the Music of Twin Peaks_ has been on repeat for me since its release. It has me so excited for the new series coming next year. Also, Xiu Xiu’s live performance that this album was commissioned for is incredible:
