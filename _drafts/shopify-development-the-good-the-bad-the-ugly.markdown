TODO:

- add link to shopify theme dev article
- add hire call out
- add description

## The Good

- Good docs (API, platform)
- Plenty of resources (community forum, other content creators)
- Liquid is enjoyable to work with
- Timber as a base theme
- Internationalization

## The Bad

- No local development - slow feedback and adjustment loop
- No sub-directories in the assets folder of the theme

## The Ugly

- No support for Sass partials, leads to gigantic stylesheets where variables, mixins, etc. can’t be shared

## Closing Thoughts

- what Shopify is good for
- what it isn’t good for
