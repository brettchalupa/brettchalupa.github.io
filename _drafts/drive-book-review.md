I finished reading _Drive_ by James Sallis this week, and I wanted to share my thoughts on it.

I enjoyed the shorter length of the novel. I think it works well for the story being told.

The atmosphere feels spot on. The way that the grittier parts of L.A. are described was great. The writing flowed nicely.

Zero female characters that aren't inconsequential. Difficult to follow (each chapter jumps in the timeline back and forth, which I found confusing)

There are shifts in tense throughout the book, which felt awkward and confusing. Maybe it is intentional, but I found it confusing.

I read the book over a few weeks, taking breaks of a few days between each time I read it. I think this made the book more difficult to follow. Because of the shorter length, only [enter page count here] pages, I think the book is best suited for one or two sittings.

The film adaption of _Drive_ is one of my favorite movies from this decade, so I was excited to read the original source. I think it works well in some regards, like how enigmatic Driver is. But I think it lacks some of the character development that the film has with respect to Driver and [the woman].

All-in-all, itâ€™s an okay read, but nothing that I am dying to read again.
