    <h1>Hi, my name is Brett Chalupa.</h1>

    <h3>I build software for the web.</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="who">
    <p>I help folks plan, design, and build software. I care about sustainable
    code, user experience, and building the the right thing.</p>

    <p>I work on the front-end and back-end of web applications, from the words in
    the app to the APIs that power it. I enjoy programming with Ruby,
    JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I believe in the web, open technologies,
    and free/libre software. I appreciate simple design, and I am capable of
    envisioning and implementing my own designs.</p>

    <p>I live in Burlington, Vermont. I live a simple life. I enjoy reading,
    writing, music, cooking, and walking.</p>
