    <h1>Hi, my name is Brett Chalupa.</h1>

    <h3>I build software for the web.</h3>

  <div class="who">
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>

    <p>I am a human being living in Burlington, Vermont. I try to live a simple life.
    I enjoy reading, writing, music, cooking, and walking.</p>

    <p>I currently work at FullStack, where I build software for clients. I work on
    the front-end and back-end of web applications, from the words in the app to
    the APIs that power it. I believe in the web and open technologies. I
    appreciate simple design, and I am capable of envisioning and implementing
    my own.</p>

    <p>I enjoy programming with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Ruby on Rails and
    Ember.js are the two frameworks that help me build things. I use Sketch for
    design, and I use Git for version control.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="what">
    <h2>What I Have Done</h2>

    <p>I most recently worked on <a
      href="https://supermarket.getchef.com">Supermarket</a>, the community site for
      Chef. I previously worked at Burton Snowboards, and I work on freelance
      projects from time to time.</p>

    <p>I occasionally <a href="/notes/">write notes</a> and <a
      href="https://github.com/brettchalupa"> work on open-source projects</a>.</p>
