    <h3>I build software for the web.</h3>

  <div class="who">
    <p>I am a human being living in Burlington, Vermont. I try to live a simple life.
    I enjoy reading, writing, music, cooking, and walking.</p>

    <p>I build software for clients. I work on the front-end and back-end of
    web applications, from the words in the app to the APIs that power it. I
    believe in the web, open technologies, and free/libre software. I appreciate
    simple design, and I am capable of envisioning and implementing my own
    designs.</p>

    <p>I enjoy programming with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Ruby on Rails and
    Ember.js are the two frameworks that get me excited about building web
    applications. I use Inkscape for design. I use Git for version control.</p>
