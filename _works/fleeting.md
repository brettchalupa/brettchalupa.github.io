![Fleeting Cover](/uploads/fleeting-cover.jpg)

An ongoing collection of short stories. My goal is to publish at least one new story a month.

A space package deliveryman recounts a particularly challenging assignment, a young engineer heads to work on a colony in orbit of the moon, a recluse witnesses a murder through his computer screen, and so on.
