The goblin onslaught won't cease. The Frog King has sent you, Frog, on a mission to... DESTROY ALL GOBLINS.

_Destroy All Goblins_ is a small freeware game for personal computers.

I made _Destroy All Goblins_ over the course of a month. It's inspired by _Super Crate Box_, and it uses art assets by [Pixel Frog](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/) from the public domain.
