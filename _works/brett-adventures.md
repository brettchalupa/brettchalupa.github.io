![Brett Adventures Cover](/uploads/brett-adventures-cover.jpg)

I record, edit, and publish videos relating to trail running, hiking, and backpacking as a way to encourage folks to get out and enjoy the great outdoors. Exploring nature while moving my body has had such a profoundly positive impact on my life, and I want to share that with others.

From field reports to gear reviews, I enjoy gettings to be creative with non-fiction storytelling. My tools are my phone, a GoPro, and Final Cut Pro.
