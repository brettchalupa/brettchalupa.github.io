A young woman with a third eye and her mentor are on the run.

Inspired by shonen battle manga, Lavender is 24-page action fantasy
comic that was made in 24 hours.

_Lavender_ is my second finished comic. It's the result of taking on a
24-Hour Comic Challenge on June 22nd & 23rd, 2018.

Black and white, 24 pages long.
