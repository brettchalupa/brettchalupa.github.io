_Growing with Godot_ is a 29 episode free video series teaching how to make video games with the Godot engine.

As I was learning Godot, I tried to capture everything I was figuring out and make accessible resources for those in a similar position.

I also created some other Godot resources:

- [Godot 4 2D Platformer Starter Kit](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/godot-2d-platformer) — video guide and source code for creating a platformer
- [Godotypes](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/godotypes) — open source samples for different game types
- [Godot Skeleton](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/godot-skeleton) — flexible starter template
