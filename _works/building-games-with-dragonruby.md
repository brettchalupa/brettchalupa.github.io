[_Building Games with DragonRuby_](https://book.dragonriders.community/) is a free, beginner-friendly book about making games with the Ruby programming language. I made it to try to help those interested in creating games get started.

The book is 12 chapters long, covering the absolute basics all the up to making a finished game.
