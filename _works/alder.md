_Alder_ started as a collection of short stories written in October 2016. I am working on adapting the stories as comics.

Read the original, published stories:

- [Latency](http://www.brettchalupa.com/latency) – A man witnesses a kidnapping and tries to help.
- [Lunar Space Colony](http://www.brettchalupa.com/lunar-space-colony) – A young woman is recruited to work on the Lunar Space Colony as an engineer.
