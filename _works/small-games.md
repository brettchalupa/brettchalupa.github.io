I have been interested in making games, particularly small ones that I can finish in less than a couple ofmonths. I love how they combine a lot of the things I love, from programming to art to music.

[Play my games.](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/) They're free and playable in the browser or on your desktop operating system.

More to come soon...
