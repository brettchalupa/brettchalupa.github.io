Hello! My name is Brett, and I am a developer living in Burlington, Vermont.

I believe in the importance of living a balanced life, crafting communities and contributing to open-source software.

I work primarily with Ruby. When building web applications I use Rails and Sinatra.

If you are looking for someone to develop a web application, [feel free to get in touch](/contact). I am always happy to help.
