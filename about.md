# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a storyteller focused on writing. I live in
Portland, Oregon.

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I try to live a simple life and
pursue my passions, which are writing, reading, cooking, and walking.

Growing up I barely read, but that all changed when read _1Q84_ by
Haruki Murakami in 2013. My mind was opened to fictional literature, and
my love of it has only grown since, so much so that I started to write
my own stories in September 2015.

Since then I have been working on small and medium-sized projects, and I
aim to self-published my first novel in the middle of 2017. I
want to support myself with my writing, and I am diligently working
towards that goal.

I currently make my living doing software development. I run <a
href='http://www.monoso.co'>Monoso</a>, small consulting firm that
specializes in building web applications. I have been building software
for over a decade, and while I enjoy it, I daydream about doing creative
work all day long. My prior technical writing and talks can be found in [the
Archive](/archive/).

I really enjoy Haruki Murakami's novels and David Lynch's films.
I love getting lost in dark and mysterious worlds.
