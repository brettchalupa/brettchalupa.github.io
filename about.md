# About

<p class='intro'>

I live in Portland, Oregon.

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I try to live a simple life and
pursue my passions, which are writing, reading, cooking, and walking.

I really enjoy Haruki Murakami's novels and David Lynch's films.
