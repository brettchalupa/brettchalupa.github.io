# About

I live in Burlington, Vermont, which I enjoy very much. The weather can be a bit
harsh, but the people are nice, the food is good, and the quality of life is
high.

My goal is to build software that people find useful. I want to be
able to build wonderful experiences from top to bottom, from the design to the
code.

Aside from building software, I enjoy cooking, reading, play video games, and
walking.

Cooking feels like a stark contrast to building software because within an hour
or so the food is ready, and shortly after, it is gone. I think that is why I
enjoy it so much.

My current favorite author is Haruki Murakami. I think my favorite
novel by him is _Kafka on the Shore_. His writing grips me, and I find it hard
to put his books down.

Lastly, I like walking because it is so simple. I do not need to wear any
special clothes or have any equipment. I can just put on my shoes and do it.
There are plently of places to walk in Burlington, and the [beautiful
