# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, writer, and comic artist. I live in Michigan.

Prior to moving to the Midwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I spent a few years in the Pacific
Northwest. I try to live a simple life and pursue my passions. I enjoy drawing,
writing, reading, and cooking. I'm most inspired by manga, film, and science
fiction works. I'm a big fan of Haruki Murakami, David Lynch, and Tsutomu Nihei.

I've been writing fiction lately.

I make my living doing software development. I work at [Big
Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com), building software to help creative
people sell their art work. My technical portfolio and resources can be
viewed at the [Monoso website](https://monoso.brettchalupa.com).
