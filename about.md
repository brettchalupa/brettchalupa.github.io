# About

When I turned 23, I decided that it was time to start something new. I
decided to start exploring creative writing. I am currently working on
short stories and a novel as part of [National Novel Writing
Month](http://nanowrimo.org/).

I work remotely for [charity: water](http://charitywater.org), where I
build web applications with Ruby on Rails.
