# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, comic artist, and illustrator. I live in Portland, Oregon.

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I try to live a simple life and
pursue my passions. I enjoy drawing, writing, reading, and cooking.
I'm most inspired by manga, film, and science fiction works. I'm a fan
of Haruki Murakami, David Lynch, and Tsutomu Nihei.

I started drawing seriously in September 2017. I'm focused on growing as
an illustrator and comic artist. My goal is to create science fiction
works that explore the possibilities of the future.

I make my living doing software development. I work at [Big
Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com), building software to help creative
people sell their art work. My technical portfolio and resources can be
viewed at the [Monoso website](http://www.monoso.co).
