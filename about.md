# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, creator, and adventurer. I live in Pennsylvania.

Prior to moving to Pennsylvania, I grew up in the Northeast, living in New
Jersey and Vermont. I spent a few years in the Pacific Northwest. I try to live
a simple life and pursue my passions. I enjoy reading, writing, walking, and
watching movies.

I make my living doing software development. I really enjoy sharing what I've
learned by making [screencasts and blog posts](https://code.brettchalupa.com).

When I'm not working with code, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, reading, and
working on creative projects. Running has become a significant part of my life.
I mostly run on trails. I dabble with writing fiction, drawing comics, and
making short films.

I love food, and I've eaten a plant-based, vegan diet for over six years.
Cooking is a true joy for me.

Some of my favorite creators are Haruki Murakami, Ursula K. Le Guin, David
Lynch, William Gibson, and Tsutomu Nihei.

A perfect day off for me would be waking up and working on creative projects for a little bitâ€”writing or editing videos. Then I'd go on a long trail run. Afterward, I'd cook a nice meal, go for a walk, and wind down with a book!
