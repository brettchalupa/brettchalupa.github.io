# About

<p class='intro'>Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a storyteller focused on
writing, and I live in Portland, Oregon.</p>

I grew up in the Northeast, living in New Jersey and Vermont, prior to
moving to the Pacific Northwest. I try to live a simple life and pursue
my passions, which have been reading, writing, cooking, and walking
lately.
