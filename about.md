# About

Howdy! I am Brett, and I live in Portland, Oregon. I try to live a
simple life and pursue my passions. I recently moved to Portland after
growing up and living in the Northeast.

I [build software](/hire/), with a focus on simple solutions and
sustainable code.

I enjoy cooking, walking, and reading.
