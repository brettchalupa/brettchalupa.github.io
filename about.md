# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, writer, and comic artist. I live in Portland, Oregon.

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I try to live a simple life and
pursue my passions. I enjoy drawing, writing, film, reading, cooking,
and walking. I'm a fan of the works by Haruki Murakami, David Lynch, and
Tsutomu Nihei.

I currently publish a weekly webcomic called
[Waves](http://waves.brettchalupa.com). I'm also working on an
unannounced graphic novel.

I make my living doing software development. My technical portfolio and
resources can be viewed at the [Monoso website](http://www.monoso.co).
