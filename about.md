# About

I live in Burlington, Vermont, which I enjoy very much. The weather can be a bit
harsh, but the people are nice, the food is good, and the quality of life is
high.

I work remotely for [charity: water](http://charitywater.org), where I
build web applications with Ruby on Rails.

I consider myself a Rubyist, and I have been programming with the Ruby
language the past five years. I also work a lot with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Lately I have been learning Go, which is a
nice change of pace from Ruby.

Aside from building software, I enjoy cooking, reading, and walking.

My current favorite author is Haruki Murakami. I think my favorite
novel by him is _Kafka on the Shore_. His writing grips me, and I find it hard
to put his books down.

Lastly, I like walking because it is so simple. I do not need to wear any
special clothes or have any equipment. I can just put on my shoes and do it.
There are plently of places to walk in Burlington, and the [beautiful
lake](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brettchalupa/5464186440/) is great scenery.

If you want to follow along with me, I am active on a few different places:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brettchalupa) - where I keep up with folks and
  share shorter thoughts
- [GitHub](https://github.com/brettchalupa) - where I share my code and
  collaborate with others
- [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25307704-brett-chalupa) - where
  I keep track of what I am reading
