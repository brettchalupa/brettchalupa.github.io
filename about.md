# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, designer, and comic artist. I live in Portland, Oregon.

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I try to live a simple life and
pursue my passions. I enjoy drawing, writing, film, reading, cooking, and
walking.

I currently publish a weekly webcomic called
[Waves](http://waves.brettchalupa.com) and write about video games at
[Peaceful Respite](http://www.peacefulrespite.com).

I make my living doing software development. I run <a
href='http://www.monoso.co'>Monoso</a>, a small consulting firm that
specializes in building web applications. I have been building software
for over a decade. My prior technical writing and talks can be found in
the [Archive](/archive/).

I spend my free time watching films, reading manga and novels, and playing the
occassional video game (Fire Emblem is my favorite series). The creators
I most look up to are Haruki Murakami, David Lynch, and Tsutomu Nihei.
I love getting lost in dark and mysterious worlds.
