# About

Hi, I am Brett. I am a human being. I try to live a simple life and
do what I love. I live in Portland, Oregon, USA. I recently moved to
Portland after growing up and living on the east coast. I am enjoying
the change of environment.

My job is doing software development for a non-profit organization
called [charity: water](http://charitywater.org). I primarly build tools
for charity: water's partners and the internal team. I work remotely. I
program with Ruby a lot.

When I am not working, I enjoy making things. From cooking to drawing to
programming, I enjoy dabbling in a variety of creative hobbies. I used
to organize [a Ruby conference in Burlington,
Vermont](http://www.burlingtonrubyconference.com/).

I enjoy reading, writing, and watching films and shows. I really like
_Twin Peaks_. My favorite author of novels is Haruki Murakami. My
favorite manga artist is Naoki Urasawa. My favorite film director is
David Lynch.

This website is my little corner of the web to share what I make and
what I am up to.
