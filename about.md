# About

I live in Burlington, Vermont, which I enjoy very much. The weather can be a bit
harsh, but the people are nice, the food is good, and the quality of life is
high.

I am originally from New Jersey, where I grew up enamored with Japanese popular
culture. I built fan-sites for anime series on the now defunct GeoCities, which
got me started with building websites. I eventually started using Wordpress to
blog about things like anime, video games, and manga.

In high school, I was fortunate enough to be able to take AP Computer Science,
where I got to learn Java. For a while, I thought I wanted to program videos
games for a living, so I moved to Vermont to go to college for game programming.

During my time at college, I worked as an apprentice where I learned all about
building software, content strategy, and collaboration. It was during this time
that I decided to leave school to pursue learning, growing, and working on my
own terms.

In the time since leaving school, I have focused primarily on building web
applications. I have been, and continue to, program a lot with Ruby, JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS. I have primarily worked with clients over the past three years,
but I have had some brief stints working full time gigs.

Ultimately, my goal is to build software that people find useful. I want to be
able to build wonderful experiences from top to bottom, from the design to the
code.

Aside from building software, I enjoy cooking, reading, and walking.

Cooking feels like a stark contrast to building software because within an hour
or so the food is ready, and shortly after, it is gone. I think that is why I
enjoy it so much.

My current favorite author is Haruki Murakami. I think my favorite
novel by him is _Kafka on the Shore_. His writing grips me, and I find it hard
to put his books down.

Lastly, I like walking because it is so simple. I do not need to wear any
special clothes or have any equipment. I can just put on my shoes and do it.
There are plently of places to walk in Burlington, and the [beautiful
