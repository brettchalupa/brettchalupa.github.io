# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer and writer. I live in Michigan.

Prior to moving to the Midwest, I grew up in the Northeast,
living in New Jersey and Vermont. I spent a few years in the Pacific
Northwest. I try to live a simple life and pursue my passions. I enjoy reading,
writing, walking, and watching movies.

I make my living doing software development. I work at [Big
Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com), building software to help creative
people sell their art.

I'm focused on writing fiction, but I've dabbled in different creative
pursuits over the years, from recording audio to drawing comics to making short
films.

Some of my favorite creators are Haruki Murakami, Ursula K. Le Guin, David
Lynch, William Gibson, and Tsutomu Nihei.
