# About

<p class='intro'>
Hi, my name is Brett. I'm a software developer, creator, and outdoor enthusiast. I live in Pennsylvania.

Prior to moving to Pennsylvania, I grew up in the Northeast, living in New
Jersey and Vermont. I spent a few years in the Pacific Northwest. I try to live
a simple life and pursue my passions. I enjoy reading, writing, walking, and
watching movies.

I make my living doing software development. I work at [Big
Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com), building software to help creative people
sell their art. [View my coding screencasts and blog posts.](https://code.brettchalupa.com)

When I'm not working my day job, I enjoy getting into the outdoors and
documenting my adventures. Lately that's been through making videos, taking
photos, and writing field reports.

I also dabble with writing fiction, drawing comics, and making short films.

I love food, and I've eaten a plant-based, vegan diet for over six years.
Cooking is a true joy for me.

Some of my favorite creators are Haruki Murakami, Ursula K. Le Guin, David
Lynch, William Gibson, and Tsutomu Nihei.
