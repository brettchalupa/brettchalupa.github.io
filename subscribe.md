# Subscribe

If youâ€™re interested in keeping up with my writing and creative projects, there are a few ways to subscribe.

{% include newsletter.html %}

## Journal & RSS

I update [my journal](/journal/) at least once a week with thoughts, project updates, monthly reflections on what I enjoyed last month, and what I have been learning.

If you want to subscribe to my journal, you can use the [RSS feed](http://www.brettchalupa.com/feed.xml). With that feed, you can subscribe with an RSS reader or set up a service like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to send you an email every time a new entry is posted.

## Social Media

I share what I have been working on regularly on social media as well.

- [Ello](https://ello.co/brettchalupa) &ndash; regular thoughts and updates
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brettchalupa) &ndash; occasional small updates
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Brett-Chalupa-607963962732935/) &ndash; weekly updates on projects
